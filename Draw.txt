RequestMapping need Postman Chrome extension fastest way to have it


1)need to setup spring boot in your ide( eclipse or intellij)
2) install docker for Windows in your laptop ( if you're using Windows os) 
3)Clone the task into ide
4)run docker-compose up to download the required db from the task
5) split the task ( acceptance criteria ) into smaller talks 
For example: it always returns 200( success) 
Now i need to implement status 400x and 500x

implement a thread class and set the timer in it to 5 seconds(this is for each retry) 
1 st retry -----wait 5 seconds-->
2nd retry -----wait 5 seconds-->
...
5th retry---> wait 5 seconds
( This whole process will happen for each email notification) 

Similarly do the second and third.




This error means my  Tom cat server is running correctly.

But unable to find the URL with email at the end.


Change the browser to v1
i ve Put a debugger point on line 23 and try to debug the app.

Instead of throwing / returning this error, return 500 for internal server error or 404 for resource not found


2) i need to Right now am doing  5 retries 


---------------------------------
i need to create two new services in the code.
1) crash notification service 
2) restart notification service
--------------------------------
1 retry ----- successful 
2 retry -----successful 
Then the sntp server crashes or goes kaputtt 
the notification service should send an error notification to the crash notification service and the crash notification 
service will start the notification service again. 
Which means my notification service should pass the retry number to 
crash notification service and crash notification service will send retry number ( which is 2) back to 
notification service and notification service will execute the remaining tries( whick is 3) 

-------------------------------


I just need to pass the retry number from
Notification->crash->restart-> notification( and this time the number of retry will be 3 not 5)
